# Tic-Tac-Toe
- Recreated the famous Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Refactored it into the MVC pattern to account for design principles such as: open-close principle and separation of concerns. 
- implemented local storage to allow users to play the game in multiple tabs 

Inspired by freecodecamps video on the MVC Architectural pattern: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsnQ5uepIaE&t=28361s
