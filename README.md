# Tic-Tac-Toe
- Recreated the famous Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Refactored it into the MVC pattern to account for design principles such as: open-close principle and separation of concerns. 
- implemented local storage to allow users to play the game in multiple tabs 

Inspired by freecodecamps video on the MVC Architectural pattern: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsnQ5uepIaE&t=28361s

# Concepts covered in this project:
1. MVC (model view controller) ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN
2. What is a state
- representation of a system in given time (in our case what moves have been played on the tic tac toe board yet)
3. Event delegation
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. CSS Animations
6. CSS Grid

# A couple notes about the MVC pattern:

Model View Controller
- commonly used for developing user interfaces
- When building the application, we have 3 separate concerns,
- 1. View
- Handle UI only events, for example: toggling the menu, displaying scoreboard
- 2. Store
- Responsible for getting state, saving state and emitting state change events
- 3. App (Coontroller)
- Orchestrates between state.js and view.js
